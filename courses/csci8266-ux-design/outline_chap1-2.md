# Essential Questions

## 1. Who wrote this book and why? 

The authors are Russ Unger and Carolyn Chandler.

The author's stated motivation is to give both the student in UX design and the full time project designer (aka practitioner) the tools and techniques to [actually practice UX design on a "living, breathing" project.](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/pref04.xhtml#pref04lev1sec1:~:text=Somewhere%2C%20there%E2%80%99s%20a,with%20working%20teams.)


## 2. What does "UX Design" mean in the context of this book? 
There is a broad definition used throughout the world, but the book focuses more narrowly. 

The broad definition, as written in the book, is:

> [The creation and synchronization of the elements that affect users’ experience with an organization’s products and services, using data-informed insights on user behavior and perception.](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch01.xhtml#ch01lev1sec1:~:text=The%20creation%20and%20synchronization%20of%20the%20elements%20that%20affect%20users%E2%80%99%20experience%20with%20an%20organization%E2%80%99s%20products%20and%20services%2C%20using%20data%2Dinformed%20insights%20on%20user%20behavior%20and%20perception.)

The book's focus, however, is on the design of digital experiences. In particular, the design of "interactive media such as websites and apps".

## 3. What are the types of products described in chapters 2 of the book? 

Chapter 2 highlights 4 different types of digital products:

- Brand presence: often the main website for the company (targets multiple audiences, often customers and potential customers, possibly investors and the media, etc.; examples from my experience: [the main website for FNBO](https://www.fnbo.com/), [the QueenB events planning website I built for Nicole](https://www.queenb.events/))

- A promotional product: "microsite" targeted at a specific audience designed for a specific goal; example from my job: [a website designed to get customers to apply for a specific credit card](https://www.universalrewardsvisa.com/media?cid=par:acq:unv:0:crc:0:psm:0:2505?partnerMarketingCode=uopdsearc4&utm_campaign=par:acq:unv:0:crc:0:psm:0:2505?partnerMarketingCode=uopdsearc4)\)

- Content source: media repository for engaging or informing users (examples from my experience: Instagram, Substack, YouTube, Microsoft SharePoint)

- Task-based application: tools for specific tasks/workflows (examples from my experience: VS Code, GitHub, the FNBO mobile app or "transaction site")

## 4. How do different devices influence UX Design? 

Several potential changes are mentioned by the authors. If mobile access is expected to be used, it helps to design "mobile first" as it helps the designer to:

> [focus on the essential data and actions in your project](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch02.xhtml#ch02lev1sec2:~:text=focus%20on%20the%20essential%20data%20and%20actions%20in%20your%20product.)

Options for mobile include:
- a single website with responsive-design
- a unique mobile web app in addition to (instead of?) a desktop website
- a native mobile app

In general, UX design should be aware of the five modalities, and how device type affects which modalities are most useful for it.

The five modalities for user feedback are:
- visual
- auditory
- haptic (vibration, feedback, clicks, etc.)
- kinetic ("movement in space"), and
- ambient: not sure about this one. They describe it as ["Inferred meaning driven by environmental or biometric conditions: temperature, heart rate, lighting, and so on."](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch02.xhtml#ch02lev1sec3:~:text=Inferred%20meaning%20driven%20by%20environmental%20or%20biometric%20conditions%3A%20temperature%2C%20heart%20rate%2C%20lighting%2C%20and%20so%20on.)

For example, a smartwatch has limited visual space and auditory output is inferior to most phones, but it excels at providing haptic feedback to users based on it's location on the body. 

## 5. What are the different types of hats a UX designer might wear?

The authors highlight 5 roles which are common in the UX field in detail:
- Information architect: structuring information for accessibility by users
- Interaction designer: creates storyboards or task flows to visualize how users behavior impacts the product
- UI designer: crafts and refines visual elements (ex: brand guideline adherence plus consistent visual appearance)
- Product designer: experiment on product changes, think about and design new features or experiences for users for continuous releases
- User researcher: provides insight based research in which users participate directly

In addition, they highlight many more as those who work _around_ UX designers on a day to day basis. On smaller teams, UX designers may also [take on these roles](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch02.xhtml#ch02lev1sec3:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20more,of%20site%20being%20designed.):

- Brand strategist or steward
- Product manager
- UX strategist
- Service designer
- Business analyst
- Content strategist
- UX writer
- Front-end developer

# Reflection questions

## 1. How would you describe the tone/feel of the book? 

I would describe the tone as conversational and grounded. 

By grounded, I mean that new concepts are usually introduced by:
1. describing the topic, then 
2. showing a giant screenshot that illustrates the idea from out "in the wild"

## 2. What other books that you've read would you say it is the most similar to in how you use it to get information?

A few years ago, I read _Clean Code_ by "Uncle Bob". This book is also full of practical examples (though he used Smalltalk as the coding language) and references to real-life projects. 

## 3. Is there a way you could improve the experience of using the book?

I'm not confident in this assertion for the purposes of an academic textbook, 
but I think the book could be be improved by the inclusion of "rules of 
thumb" or "tldrs" that summarize the content of a section.

_Clean Code_ often summarized its guidelines _first_, then moved on
to detailed descriptions and examples, which I found helpful.

These could be placed at the top of a section and help readers:
- distill the most important insight from the section, and
- understand whether the contents of that section are already 
familiar to them.

# Questions I still have

1. What is an example of using the "ambient" modality to provide user feedback? I can see it as an input (ex: Apple Watch heart rate sensor), but can't think of it as an example output. 

# Miscellania

## Iconography used to organize info in book
- `Surboard` icon indicates links to ["shorter features (usually online) that will take 5 to 30 minutes to read."](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/pref04.xhtml#pref04lev1sec6:~:text=shorter%20features%20(usually%20online)%20that%20will%20take%205%20to%2030%20minutes%20to%20read.)
- `Snorkeling` icon indcates links to white papers or short books (up to a weekend)
- `Diver's helmet` icons indicate links to books that take more than a weekend

## Stuff I liked
 
- Podcast recommendation: [UI Breakfas](https://uibreakfast.com/category/podcast/)

- Good quote: ["one of the best things you can do out of the gate is to identify key people who could be partners and schedule some interview time with them to understand their roles and experience"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch02.xhtml#ch02lev1sec3:~:text=one%20of%20the%20best%20things%20you%20can%20do%20out%20of%20the%20gate%20is%20to%20identify%20key%20people%20who%20could%20be%20partners%20and%20schedule%20some%20interview%20time%20with%20them%20to%20understand%20their%20roles%20and%20experience)

- Questions to bring to work:
    - What is an example of a past project that seems to have been considered a success, and what seems to have made it so? 
    - What is a past project that seems to have been a failure (or particularly painful), and why did it fail?
